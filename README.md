Copy or move the `Monkey.bbpackage` file to the folder at:

If the folder does not exist, you will need to create it.

You may need to restart BBEdit for the changes to take effect.

## Color Scheme
As a nice little bonus, I've also converted my preferred theme to a BBEdit Color Scheme:

## TextWrangler
If you don't own BBEdit but fancy trying some of the functions of this package, give TextWrangler a whirl.
